=== Basic Usage ================================================================
================================================================================
The autoclear plugin lets you set default text for text input fields. There are 
many out there, but this one is the best.

The simplest way to get going with autoclear is to set up your input fields as 
follows:
  <input type="text" name="name" value="Name" />
  <input type="text" name="age" value="Age" />
and let autoclear do the rest of the work with:
  $('input:text').autoclear();
  
That's all there is to it!
  
By default, autoclear will add a "default" class to those text fields that are 
showing the default value and a class of "other" for those that aren't. 
using this, we can apply some simple CSS rules to help the user differentiate 
between them.
  .default {
    color: #FF0000; 
  }
  
Lovely.

What about the scenario where you're showing something like an edit form; i.e 
you want some other values to appear in the field to start off, but when these 
get cleared, you want to continue using autoclear. Whilst most auto-clearing 
plugins will cry at this point, with autoclear it's easy!

Autoclear first checks the title attribute of the input field for a value. 
If one is set, this is used as the "default" text. If none is set, it will 
prefer the "value" field. If this is also empty, it will finally fall back 
to whatever the "defaultValue" is set to in autoclear's settings; but we'll 
come onto those in a second.
  <input type="text" title="Name" value="Amy"/>

In the above example, "Amy" is shown when the page first loads, but as soon as 
the user clears this text, "Name" is shown as you would expect.

Just to clarify; the order of preference:
  title
  value
  settings.defaultValue
  
The autoclear plugin also extends the native jQuery.fn.val() function. 
If the contents of an autoclearing-textfield is retrieved using val(), and the
default text is being displayed, val() will intelligently return ''. If an 
autoclearing-textfield is showing the helper text, and you use val() to change 
it to a valid value, autoclear will alter the styling accordingly. If you set 
input value to be '' using val(''), autoclear will intelligently change the
value to the default text, and apply the appropiate styling.

================================================================================
=== Advanced Usage =============================================================
================================================================================
autoclear accepts up to two parameters.

.autoclear(defaultClass);
.autoclear(settingsObject);

defaultClass is a string that is used as the class name when the input field is 
showing the "default" value. If this is omitted, it will apply the "default" 
class.

settingsObject is a map that defines and overrides the various settings of 
autoclear. Valid values are as follows:

Setting               Type      Default   Definition
defaultClass          String    default   The class applied when the input field
                                          is showing the "default" text
otherClass            String    other     The class applied when the input field
                                          is showing something other than the 
                                          "default" text
defaultValue          String              The value used as the "default" text. 
                                          This value is only used if both the 
                                          title and value attributes of the 
                                          input field are undefined
useDefaultOnReset     Boolean   true      If the input field was in the form 
                                          <input type="text" title="Name" 
                                                             value="Amy"/>, 
                                          if the form is reset should the value 
                                          be set to "Name" (true) or "Amy" 
                                          (false).
clearDefaultOnSubmit  Boolean   true      When the form is submitted, if the 
                                          value of the input field is the 
                                          default value, should it be cleared to
                                          '' before it is sent to the server?
